### Hello everyone!

Junior frontend developer here!ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Maiken and I recently finished two years of Noroff School of technology and digital media studying Front end development. 
Besides working with the projects in school, I have been using my imagination to make professional webpages for fictive places like f.ex. Miss Robichauxs Academy, which is the school portrayed in season 3 of American Horror Story. Watching the episodes where this school was introduced and the organization was talking about their goals and vision helped me find the vibe and see what kind of webpage I should make. It is important to get to know the business/organization to be able to help them show their best selves, and to reflect what they are trying to accomplish.
If you want to visit the school site it is first important to know that none of the written materials or photographs are mine. Please see citation and acknowledgements here: Coming soon... or by clicking "Miss Robichaux's Academy" at the bottom of the page. Check out the site: https://miss-robichauxs-academy.netlify.app/ 

Making these kinds of websites gives me a lot practice for upcoming real projects.

I am currently working on improving my portfolio by adjusting to the Heroku and Strapi changes that have occurred recently, but also have a few other projects in mind which will be pushed at a later time.

I have not worked on any real life projects yet, but I do have my own e-commerce selling witchy and Halloween items. You are welcome to visit the site which is made using Wordpress and Chic Lite theme template: https://svartsalt.no/ 

At last, I find a lot of fun and enjoyment in making simple online games. In my downtime I am currently learning how to make something bigger through "Let's build an RPG with JavaScript - Part 1: Project Beginnings #pizzalegends" with Drew Conley. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyi4vfbKEeo. It is all god fun, and he has his own Discord server with many helpful developers to get familiar with.

If you find the repositories interesting you can always reach out to collaborate. 

I am also looking for jobs, so please do not hesitate to contact me if you need more people in you business/organisation.
